# Vibe Check

Vibe Check is a Streamlit app for NYC apartment hunters who want to evaluate neighborhood conditions before committing to a lease. Instead of asking only about rent, amenities, or commute time, the app answers a user-facing question a renter could plausibly ask:

> Given the urban problems I personally want to avoid, which NYC areas show the strongest or weakest 311 complaint patterns for those concerns?

The app uses NYC 311 Service Requests, semantic matching over complaint categories, and a from-scratch k-means clustering implementation to produce a map plus ranked lists of lower-concern areas and hotspots.

## Data

The project uses the NYC 311 Service Requests dataset. The full dataset is too large to store directly in this repository, so users should download it separately before running the full app.

Download the full CSV from Google Drive:

[311_Service_Requests_from_20250427_to_20260427.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vdg9G5mloXda-wq8HMNes-2JV9m4n85B/view)

Place the downloaded CSV under:

```text
data/raw/311_Service_Requests_from_20250427_to_20260427.csv
```

The repository also includes a small sample file:

```text
data/raw/311_example_2.csv
```

The sample file is useful for smoke tests and quick setup checks, but the full dataset is recommended for the actual Streamlit demo and final results.

The full dataset used for this project covers April 27, 2025 through April 27, 2026.

The app's data loader looks for data in this order:

1. A processed file at `data/processed/cleaned_raw_311.csv`, if it already exists.
2. A full raw CSV under `data/raw/`.
3. The sample file at `data/raw/311_example_2.csv`.

The preprocessing script reads from `data/raw/` and prefers the full dataset when it is available. It also supports the original `311_Service_Requests_from_2020_to_Present_*.csv` naming pattern of NYC Open Data for compatibility.

The preprocessing pipeline keeps the columns needed for the recommendation workflow:

```text
Created Date, Problem, Problem Detail, Incident Zip, Borough, Latitude, Longitude, recency_weight
```

Records are filtered to April 27, 2025 through April 27, 2026.

The `recency_weight` column gives more weight to recent complaints:

```text
recency_weight = exp(-lambda * delta_days)
lambda = 0.01
```

where `delta_days` is the number of days between the most recent complaint date in the loaded dataset and the complaint's `Created Date`.

## System Overview

Vibe Check is designed as a modular pipeline that connects semantic understanding of user intent with spatial analysis of complaint data.

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Semantic Matching Layer**  
   Converts user input into structured complaint categories using transformer-based embeddings and cosine similarity.

2. **Spatial Clustering Layer**  
   Groups complaint locations using a from-scratch implementation of k-means clustering, producing localized neighborhood regions.

3. **Ranking and Visualization Layer**  
   Scores each cluster based on concern share and complaint density, and presents the results through an interactive map and ranked lists.

This pipeline allows the system to translate subjective user concerns into objective, data-driven neighborhood recommendations.

## Method

First, the app maps the user's free-form concern text to relevant 311 complaint categories. It embeds complaint category labels with `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` and ranks categories by a numpy cosine-similarity calculation against the user's query.

Second, the app clusters the latitude/longitude points for the matched complaints. This is the course algorithm implemented from scratch in [src/clustering.py](src/clustering.py). It does not call `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`.

The k-means implementation:

1. Initializes up to `k` unique latitude/longitude centroids with a fixed random seed.
2. Assigns each matched complaint point to the nearest centroid using squared Euclidean distance.
3. Recomputes each centroid as the mean latitude/longitude of the points assigned to that cluster.
4. Repeats assignment and centroid updates until centroid movement is below `1e-5`, assignments stop changing, or 50 iterations have run.
5. Assigns all 311 complaints to the final centroids to compute a local baseline for each cluster.

Third, each cluster is ranked by a normalized severity score:

```text
severity_score = sum(recency_weight_i * similarity_i)
concern_share = severity_score / baseline_score
reliability_factor = log(1 + matched_complaint_count)
normalized_severity = concern_share * reliability_factor
```

`concern_share` measures how much of the local complaint volume matches the user's selected concerns. The `log(1 + matched_complaint_count)` factor keeps absolute complaint count in the score without letting very large neighborhoods dominate linearly. It also reduces the chance that a tiny cluster with only one or two matching complaints ranks too highly just because its share is large.

## Setup

Clone the repository and create a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CS-473-Talented-Lynxes/Vibe-Check.git
cd Vibe-Check
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows Command Prompt
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

If PowerShell blocks script activation, run this once in the current shell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are on an Intel-based Mac and the default PyTorch install fails, use the Intel-specific dependency set instead:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-mac-intel.txt
```

This file pins `torch==2.2.2`, `transformers<4.40.0`, and `numpy<2` for older Intel Mac compatibility.

Download the full dataset from Google Drive and place it under `data/raw/`:

```text
data/raw/311_Service_Requests_from_20250427_to_20260427.csv
```

Then run preprocessing:

```bash
python src/data/preprocess.py
```

This creates:

```text
data/processed/cleaned_raw_311.csv
```

If the processed file exists, the app uses it first. If it does not exist, the app falls back to a compatible raw CSV under `data/raw/`, then to the included sample file. The preprocessing script uses the full raw dataset when present and otherwise falls back to the sample file.

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Run the command-line demo:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
